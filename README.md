## Usage

### With [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Open Workspace Settings by pressing **Ctrl + ,** or **âŒ˜ + ,**.

Choose schema URL correspondent to AWS region you going to use and add JSON Schema setting like this.

```json
{
  "json.schemas": [
    {
      "fileMatch": ["*.cfn.json"],
      "url": "https://y13i.github.io/cfn-schema/us-west-2.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

Save your template file with the extension `.cfn.json`. That's it.

If you prefer YAML, use [YAML Support by Red Hat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) extension and set like this.

```json
{
  "yaml.schemas": {
    "https://y13i.github.io/cfn-schema/us-west-2.json": "*.cfn.yaml"
  }
}
```
